classes are placed modularly, to make code updates simple and efficient.
In order to add a new mod simply add a new package to com.TRGames28 that contains all necessary mod information.
Custom class in sub mods, such as copper mod, should reference classes in the general package as their base. Such as extending BlockBase, which is under general.objects.
